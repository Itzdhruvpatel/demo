the process after installing git are:
1. first we have to configure the file on git with our name and email to config use git config --global user.name "//name" , git config --global user.email "email" , git config --list
2. then we have to import the repo to the code editor by git clone "link" and check its status ; git status
3. status are of four types : untracted (new file added), modified(some thing is modified) , staged(the file is added but not commited) , unmodified(means the changes are commited or no changes are made)
4. in order to add we use git add <filename> to commit we use git commit - m (some message)
5. now we have to push to our github (remote) or to upload local repo content to remote repo ; git push origin main
