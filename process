the process after installing git are:
1. first we have to configure the file on git with our name and email
2. then we have to import the repo to the code editor byb git clone "link" and check its status 
3. status are of four types : untracted (new file added), modified(some thing is modified) , staged(the file is added but not commited) , unmodified(means the changes are commited or no changes are made)
4. in order to add we use git add <filename> to commit we use git commit - m (some message)
5. now we have to push to our github (remote) or to upload local repo content to remote repo
