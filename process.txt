the process after installing git are:
1. first we have to configure the file on git with our name and email to config use git config --global user.name "//name" , git config --global user.email "email" , git config --list
2. then we have to acces that folder created by cd this changes the directory
3. then we have to import the repo to the code editor by git clone "link" and check its status ; git status
4. status are of four types : untracted (new file added), modified(some thing is modified) , staged(the file is added but not commited) , unmodified(means the changes are commited or no changes are made)
5. in order to add we use git add <filename> to commit we use git commit - m (some message) to add every thing at once use git add . then git commit -m "msg"
6. now we have to push to our github (remote) or to upload local repo content to remote repo ; git push origin main
 
 to make a new directory we use command : mkdir 'name'
